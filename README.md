:seedling: This project is in early alpha.

HertzScript (abbreviated "HzScript") takes your regular existing JavaScript source code as input, and transforms it into an interruptable coroutine system with voluntary preemption. A new keyword is introduced named `spawn` which allows you to run several functions concurrently.

This project is part of a larger effort to implement preemptively multitasked Green threads in (and only in) JavaScript, and was initially created as the core executor of the [Hertzfeld Kernel](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzfeld-kernel).

## FAQ

**Q:** *What problem does HertzScript solve?*

**A:** In regular JavaScript, if another function is busy executing just as a `setTimeout` timer reaches itâ€™s scheduled deadline, then that timer will miss the deadline. If you want to have reliable multitasking in a single process, this problem presents a significant roadblock, and reduces the overall multitasking capacity while adding significant jitter to the system. With concurrency, constructs such as an asynchronous event loop become obsolete, and reliable multitasking can be achieved.

**Q:** *How does it solve that problem?*

**A:**  By adding concurrent execution to your existing JavaScript source code, automatically transforming all subroutines into interruptible coroutines, and eliminating run-time blocking by giving you the ability to interrupt/preempt/pause any JavaScript function's execution at nearly any point in the control flow. You can use an optional `spawn` keyword to start new coroutines.

**Q:** *Why would I need this?*

**A:** You need this if you feel that the asynchronous JS event loop is slowly killing you. HertzScript allows developers to reliably multitask between several functions on a single thread without manually implementing it or using the event loop. If you're already manually writing cooperatively multitasked source code, and/or need reliable single-process multitasking, then HzScript could take over this responsibility for you. If you're implementing [Green threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads), then the HzScript dispatcher could serve as an executor for each thread.

## High-Level Synopsis

HertzScript implements two systems:

- A [coroutine compiler](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzscript-compiler) which consists of a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transformation plugin and an [Acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) parser plugin.

- A [coroutine dispatcher](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzscript-dispatcher) which executes the resulting source code.

Normally, coroutines are reserved for cooperative multitasking, but HertzScript implements a special type named voluntary preemptive multitasking. In regular cooperative-style programmers must declare points at which programs will yield, and HzScript extends this concept by automating it. Babel is used to transform all source code so that it is able to run concurrently, and Acorn is used to parse a special `spawn` keyword which acts as the primary interface to utilize that concurrency.

The source code which the compiler produces can be output in one of two forms:

1. A self-running platform-agnostic JavaScript module which transparently integrates with existing software.

2. A specialized HzModule which can be directly imported into a coroutine dispatcher.

## Theory of Operation

### Compiler Pipeline

[The HertzScript compiler](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzscript-compiler) uses a multi-stage source-to-source compilation pipeline to transform JavaScript functions into instruction streams; all functions within a HzScript program are GeneratorFunctions which yield instructions.

The first stage in the compilation pipeline consists of Acorn, an Acorn parser plugin, and Acorn-Walk, which are used to parse and transform any `SpawnExpression` to a regular method call for Babel to recognize in the second stage. `spawn` is a contextual keyword which could also be a regular method call and not a `SpawnExpression`, so the parser looks for any instance of the `spawn` keyword followed by any number of spaces and an identifier character.

The second stage consists of Babel and a Babel transformation plugin which is used to transform all function expressions/statements into GeneratorFunctions, and wrap all functions in detour hooking functions. Within the new GeneratorFunctions all CallExpressions, NewExpressions, ReturnStatements, YieldExpressions, and SpawnExpressions are transformed into yielded instruction tokens. A special token named `loopYield` is added to the beginning of each loop to ensure that they are interruptable.

### Function Detours

The Babel transformation plugin wraps all functions in calls detour functions, and the detour library is a list of function hooks designed to detour specific types of functions:

- `hookCoroutine` detours a function.
- `hookArrowCoroutine` detours an arrow function.
- `hookGenerator` detours a GeneratorFunction.
- `hookIterator` detours an iterator object's functions `next`, `return`, and `throw`.

All hooks insert a detour which replaces the original function with a special invocation adapter, and upon invoking the adapter a new coroutine dispatcher is started in-place while the original function is run within it. The original function is assigned to a Symbol property named `tokenSym`. Each hook marks the detour and original function with special markers symbols which allow the coroutine dispatcher to observe information that would originally only be visible at compile-time.

- `tokenSym` is assigned as a property which points to the original function.
- `crtSym` marks a function as a coroutine.
- `conSym` marks a function as a constructor coroutine.
- `genSym` marks a function as a generator.
- `iterSym` marks a function as belonging to an iterator object.

### Coroutine Dispatcher

To facilitate the aforementioned instruction stream transformations while preserving normal JavaScript execution, the [HertzScript coroutine dispatcher](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzscript-dispatcher) implements the instruction set and executes the compiled source code. The dispatcher consumes the instructions which are yielded by the compiled source code, performing the appropriate operations in response to each instruction.

HertzScript's coroutine dispatcher changes how the call stack is utilized in a JavaScript VM. When a new coroutine is started, a new Coroutine Control Block is created for it which contains a virtual call stack, and the HzScript instruction set corresponds with operations which push and pop the coroutines in that stack. Only the currently executing coroutine will reside within the JavaScript VM call stack.

The JavaScript VM call stack does not grow past the currently running coroutine except during function calls which were initiated by many of JavaScript's standard operators which are not the invocation operator, loosely limiting the VM call stack to a set length. The end result of this size reduction is that all coroutines are generally able to perform a context switch with `O(1)` time complexity, significantly reducing any possible jitter that would critically impact multitasking operation.

### Instruction Tokens

The HertzScript instruction set is a list of "instruction tokens" and is composed of Kernelizer objects, which are generic objects designed to safely wrap user data. Some instruction tokens accept arguments in an array which are assigned to properties in itself via a `set` method. All tokens are gauranteed to only be in-use during 1 cycle because the coroutine dispatcher executes in a single thread, and so each instruction token is a single-instance uniqueness type to reduce memory overhead.

All instruction tokens are marked by having a special symbol assigned to them called `kernSym`, and if the coroutine dispatcher determines that an object has the symbol as a property then it assumes that the object is an instruction token and attempts to process it.

Instruction tokens are classified by two types:

`loopYield` is a special token which is used to interrupt loops, and does not wrap user datum or invoke any functions.

1. **Invocation Tokens** wrap userland functors and any operands needed to invoke them.

- `call` & `callArgs` invoke a function with and without arguments.
- `callMethod` & `callMethodArgs` invoke a method.
- `new` & `newArgs` invoke a constructor.
- `newMethod` & `newMethodArgs` invoke a constructor from a method.
- `spawn` & `spawnArgs` spawn a new coroutine.
- `spawnMethod` & `spawnMethodArgs` spawn a new corotuine from a method.

2. **Data Tokens** wrap arbitrary userland datum, such as for `return` and `yield`.

- `return` & `returnValue` wraps a `return`.
- `yield` & `yieldValue` wraps a `yield`.

## Concurrent Programming with `spawn`

Due to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript, only one function may be run at any time, but HertzScript allows you to utilize concurrency via a new keyword named `spawn`. If you call a function which is preceded by the `spawn` keyword, then the function will run concurrently alongside any other functions, including the caller function!

### Example: Busy-Wait Timers

In the below example, we call two functions which [busy-wait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting). Using a busy-wait does not make any sense in any JavaScript execution environment, however it is an easy way to demonstrate how HertzScript provides concurrency.

The first busy-wait duration is 5000ms, while the second one is 1000ms. You can probably guess what happens when you execute this script.

```JavaScript
const performance = require("perf_hooks").performance;

function sleep(ms) {
	const start = performance.now();
	const end = start + ms;
	while (performance.now() < end);
	console.log("Slept for " + (performance.now() - start) + "ms");
}

sleep(5000);
sleep(1000);
```

The following will be logged to console:

```
Slept for 5000ms
Slept for 1000ms
```

As expected, the order of each log indicates that the second busy-wait had to wait until the first busy-wait had completed.

If we invoke our two busy-wait functions using `spawn`, then they do not block each other from executing, and their logs swap positions:

```JavaScript
spawn sleep(5000);
spawn sleep(1000);
```

The above code would then log something like this:

```
Slept for 1000ms
Slept for 5000ms
```

### Example: RedLight GreenLight with Channels

In the game Statues, a designated person (the "Curator") calls out "stop" and "go" commands to the other players.

In the below example, a Curator is created whith three methods, `redLight`, `greenLight`, and `quit`. We then `spawn` two "players" which infintiely loop, checking to see if the Curator has given a different command. Every time the command changes, the players log it to console. If the Curator gives a command to stop the game, then the players `break` out of their infinite loops.

```JavaScript
function Curator(channel) {
	channel.write("Wait...");
	this.redLight = () => channel.write("Red Light!");
	this.greenLight = () => channel.write("Green Light!");
	this.quit = () => channel.write("Quit!");
}

function player(name, channel) {
	const reader = new Channel.Reader(channel);
	var lastCommand = "";
	// Loop forever!
	while (true) {
		const command = reader.read();
		if (command && command !== lastCommand) {
			console.log(name + ": " + command);
			if (command === "Quit!") break;
			lastCommand = command;
		}
	}
}

const Channel = require("./Channel.js");
const channel = new Channel("string");
const curator = new Curator(channel);

spawn player("Player 1", channel);
spawn player("Player 2", channel);

curator.redLight();
curator.greenLight();
curator.redLight();
curator.greenLight();
curator.quit();
```

The above code logs the following to console:

```
Player 1: Wait...
Player 2: Wait...
Player 1: Red Light!
Player 2: Red Light!
Player 1: Green Light!
Player 2: Green Light!
Player 1: Red Light!
Player 2: Red Light!
Player 1: Green Light!
Player 2: Green Light!
Player 1: Quit!
Player 2: Quit!
```
